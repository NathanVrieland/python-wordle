# pywordle
 wordle clone I made in python
## usage
this needs to be run in a bash terminal ([windows terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701#activetab=pivot:overviewtab), linux terminal) **NOT CMD / POWERSHELL** I use ANSI escape characters that only work on bash terminals

if you're on windows and have windows terminal installed, run launch.bat

if you're on linux, run launch.sh

## features 
randomized word each time you play

uses actual word list from wordle
